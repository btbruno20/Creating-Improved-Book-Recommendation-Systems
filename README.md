# Flatiron_Capstone_Book_Rec_Sys
A tailored recommendation system that matches readers with the best book based on other readers' recommendations.
Best recommendation system used an SVD collaborative model to obtain the lowest error rate.
Cold start issues and user accuracy are greatly improved when users input 10 or more of their preferences in their initial input when using the recommendation system.
Future insights would involve altered max user sample size to see if it alters the accuracy of the recommendation system. User rewards for inputing their ratings for books they've read, and a user to user style recommendation sytem that offers the ability to socially connect if both are willing.
